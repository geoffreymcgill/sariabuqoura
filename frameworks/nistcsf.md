# NIST Cybersecurity (CSF)

## Abstract
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.

The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

## Framework Components & Useage 

### What

A risk-based cybersecurity framework that defines what security outcomes should be achieved across the organization through five functions:
* Identify.
* Protect.
* Detect.
* Respond.
* Recover.

### Why

* Establishes a common language between business and security teams
* Enables risk-driven decision making instead of tool-driven security
* Improves resilience and incident readiness
* Supports regulatory, audit, and governance expectations

### When

* When establishing or improving a cybersecurity program
* In regulated or high-risk environments (e.g., banking, critical infrastructure)
* After incidents, audit findings, or risk assessments
* When leadership requires visibility into cybersecurity risk

### How

* Identify critical assets, services, and risks
* Assess current controls against CSF functions
* Define a target security posture (Target Profile)
* Build and execute a prioritized improvement roadmap
* Continuously measure, review, and mature capabilities

### Where

* At the governance and risk management layer
* As a bridge between business strategy and technical controls
* Integrated with standards like ISO 27001, CIS Controls, COBIT
* Applied organization-wide across IT, security, risk, and operations
