# NIST Cybersecurity (CSF)

## Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. 

It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization regardless of its size, sector, or maturity to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.

> [!NOTE] Outcomes
> * Outcomes are clear, measurable security results that an organization aims to achieve.
> * Outcomes describe the desired security state.
> * Controls, Tools, and Processes exist only to achieve these outcomes. 
> * Example: “Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing systems”. This is an outcome, not “use firewall” or “install IAM tool”, Technology-agnostic (no vendor lock-in)

## Framework
### Components 

==- 1- CSF Core
A set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by Function, then Category, and finally Subcategory, as shown in Fig.1. 
The structure of the Core is intended to resonate most with those charged with operationalizing risk management within an organization.
The CSF Core Functions — GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER.

==- 2- CSF Organizational Profiles
A mechanism for describing an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes.

===
==- 3- CSF Tiers
Can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices.

### Components Benefit 
An organization can use the `CSF Core`, `Profiles`, and `Tiers` with the supplementary resources to:
* Understand, assess. (Describe the current or target cybersecurity posture) 
* Prioritize. (Identify, organize, and prioritize actions for managing cybersecurity risks)
* Communicate cybersecurity risks.  (Provide a common language for communicating inside and outside the organization about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, needs, and expectations)


!!!warning Warning
* Before version 2.0, the Cybersecurity Framework was called the “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.” This title is not used for CSF 2.0. 
* The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.
* This document describes what desirable outcomes an organization can aspire to achieve. It does not prescribe outcomes nor how they may be achieved. 
* Descriptions of how an organization can achieve those outcomes are provided in a suite of online resources that complement the CSF and are available through the NIST CSF website. https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework
