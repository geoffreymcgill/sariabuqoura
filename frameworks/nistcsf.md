# NIST Cybersecurity (CSF)

## Overview
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. 

It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization regardless of its size, sector, or maturity to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.

> [!NOTE] Outcomes
> * Outcomes are clear, measurable security results that an organization aims to achieve.
> * Outcomes describe the desired security state.
> * Controls, Tools, and Processes exist only to achieve these outcomes. 
> * Example: “Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing systems”. This is an outcome, not “use firewall” or “install IAM tool”, Technology-agnostic (no vendor lock-in)

!!!warning Warning
* Before version 2.0, the Cybersecurity Framework was called the “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.” This title is not used for CSF 2.0. 
* The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

## CSF Components
!!!
This document describes what desirable outcomes an organization can aspire to achieve. It does not prescribe outcomes nor how they may be achieved. 
Descriptions of how an organization can achieve those outcomes are provided in a suite of online resources that complement the CSF and are available through the NIST CSF website. https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework

==- CSF Organizational Profiles
A mechanism for describing an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes
===
==- CSF Tiers
Can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices
===


### What

A risk-based cybersecurity framework that defines what security outcomes should be achieved across the organization through five functions:
* Identify.
* Protect.
* Detect.
* Respond.
* Recover.

### Why

* Establishes a common language between business and security teams
* Enables risk-driven decision making instead of tool-driven security
* Improves resilience and incident readiness
* Supports regulatory, audit, and governance expectations

### When

* When establishing or improving a cybersecurity program
* In regulated or high-risk environments (e.g., banking, critical infrastructure)
* After incidents, audit findings, or risk assessments
* When leadership requires visibility into cybersecurity risk

### How

* Identify critical assets, services, and risks
* Assess current controls against CSF functions
* Define a target security posture (Target Profile)
* Build and execute a prioritized improvement roadmap
* Continuously measure, review, and mature capabilities

### Where

* At the governance and risk management layer
* As a bridge between business strategy and technical controls
* Integrated with standards like ISO 27001, CIS Controls, COBIT
* Applied organization-wide across IT, security, risk, and operations
